# Attendance-Taker-by-Scanning-Faces
This is a Software not a script which will detect the multiple faces at a single time. This application is all about taking attendance of Students and Faculties by scanning faces. Our aim is to avoid the discrepancy of attendance in the schools and universities. This will not only help teachers and students to make the attendance taking process easier but also help them to keep the records in the databases through creating excel sheets of respective faculty. However, this will not only avoid the controversies but also increase the ratio in attendance comparatively to the current one. Student will be automatically marked absent in the database if he/she is not present in the class.
